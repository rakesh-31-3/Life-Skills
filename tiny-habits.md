### Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

#### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Most interesting for me Idea:** "Set the habit you want to make right after something you already do."

- Do 2 pushups right after going to the bathroom or flossing just 1 tooth after brushing your teeth. What's important is to make the habit TINY so that you will do it no matter how tired or unmotivated you are, yet you will be creating the seed for a good habit nonetheless.

### Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

#### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

1. M stands for Motivation - The motivation needed to perform the behavior.
2. A stands for Ability - The ability required to perform the behavior.
3. P stands for Prompt - The trigger.

- The main idea is that for a new habit to be formed, Motivation and Ability need to be high enough to rise above the "Action Line" and actually perform the behavior when the Prompt occurs.

- The trick is to start super small—make the habit so tiny that it’s really easy to do (takes 30 seconds or less).
- This way, even a little motivation is enough to get started.
- Then, I keep doing it, until I feel good about my progress, which motivates me to do more over time.

#### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

1. It helps build your confidence and motivation.
2. When we celebrate even the smallest successes, our confidence in our ability to make the habit grows quickly. This increased motivation allows us to take on more difficulty with the habit over time.
3. It's a critical component of habit development. BJ Fogg's research has found that learning to celebrate after tiny wins is essential for making habits stick. Without this celebration, we are less likely to sustain the habit long-term.

### Book Summary of Atomic Habits

#### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

- The book emphasizes that changing your identity is more important than changing your outcomes.
- It suggests focusing on becoming the type of person you want to be, rather than just trying to achieve a specific goal.
- This shift in mindset is key to building lasting habits.

#### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book says to make habits easier by:

**Making the cues obvious** - put reminders and things you need in plain sight.

**Reducing the effort** - make the habit actions simple and easy to do.

**Adding immediate rewards** - find ways to make the habit satisfying right away.

The key is to set up your environment and routines to minimize friction and make good habits the path of least resistance.

#### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The book says to make bad habits harder by:

**Hiding the triggers** - remove the cues that make you want to do the bad habit.

**Making it unappealing** - reframe the habit to be less desirable.

**Increasing the effort** - add more steps or obstacles to make it harder to do.

**Removing the rewards** - eliminate the immediate gratification from the bad habit.

### Reflection:

#### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

here's how I'll build the habit of solving a daily LeetCode problem before my morning bath:

1. To make it obvious:

- Put a bright note on the bathroom mirror saying "LeetCode Time!"
- Set a 7am alarm on my phone as a reminder.

2. To make it attractive:

- Listen to an upbeat playlist while I work on the problem.
- Celebrate when I solve a problem successfully.

3. To make it easy:

- Do the problem right after brushing my teeth.
- Start with just 10-15 minutes per day.

4. To make it satisfying:

- Enjoy a relaxing bath after finishing the problem.
- Track my progress over time.
- Treat myself to a healthy breakfast.

I'm confident I can make this a sustainable habit by focusing on these key areas. It may take some trial and error, but I'm excited to see the results!

#### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

here's how I'll work on eliminating my habit of using social media too much:

1. To make it invisible:

- Remove social media apps from my phone.
- Turn off notifications for social media.
- Keep my phone away when I'm working.

2. To make it unattractive:

- Unfollow accounts that make me feel bad.
- Remind myself how much time I waste on it.

3. To make it hard:

- Set limits for the apps.
- Only check it at set times, like morning and evening.

4. To make it unsatisfying:

- Replace it with better activities like reading or exercise.
- Reward myself when I resist the urge to check it.

By tackling this habit from multiple angles, I'm confident I can reduce my social media use over time. It'll take effort, but I'm committed to reclaiming my focus and attention.
