## Focus Management

#### 1. What is Deep Work?

- Deep work is about being able to concentrate deeply on complex, intellectually challenging work.

- Intense focus may be most evident in highly technical fields, the author argues it's an important skill across many knowledge-based professions.

- The ability to engage in deep work, without getting distracted, is a valuable skill that the author believes is often underappreciated in modern work environments.

#### 2. According to author how to do deep work properly, in a few points?

The author Cal Newport provides 3 main strategies to cultivate deep work:

1. Schedule your distraction periods:

- Avoid allowing yourself to get distracted by checking phones, emails, etc. at any moment.
- Set specific times for distraction breaks and stick to those boundaries to train your brain to focus.

2. Develop a rhythmic deep work ritual:

- Establish a regular, habitual time for deep work, such as early mornings.
- Aim to gradually increase your deep work sessions from 1 hour to up to 4 hours per day.

3. Implement a daily shutdown complete ritual:

- Make a plan for the next day to get tasks and projects off your mind.
- This allows you to properly disconnect and restore your attention for the next day's deep work.

#### 3. How can you implement the principles in your day to day life?

1. Schedule distraction breaks:

- Identify times when I tend to get distracted (e.g. checking email, or social media) and set specific times for those activities.
- Use a notepad to write down when the scheduled distraction break will be, and resist the urge to check things until then.
- Gradually increase the time between distraction breaks to build my focus.

2. Establish a deep work routine:

- Designate a regular time each day (e.g. early morning) for deep, focused work.
- Create a ritual around this time to signal to my brain it's time to concentrate (e.g. closing email, turning off notifications).
- Start with 1 hour of deep work and gradually increase the duration as you build the habit.

3. Implement an end-of-day shutdown ritual:

- Before the end of my workday, review what you accomplished and make a plan for the next day.
- Mentally "shut down" by saying a cue like "shutdown complete" to signal the end of the workday.
- Avoid doing additional work in the evening so I can properly rest and recharge.

#### 4. What are the dangers of social media, in brief?

- Social media apps are designed to be addictive, like gambling machines, to keep you constantly using them.

- Constantly checking social media makes it hard to focus and do deep, important work. This hurts our career.

- Seeing perfect images of others' lives on social media makes us feel lonely and unhappy.

- The way social media works doesn't match how our brains are made to function, causing anxiety.

- The skills rewarded on social media are easy to copy and not very valuable, unlike the rare, valuable skills needed to succeed.

- In general, the speech argues that social media has serious negative effects, both on our productivity and our mental health. It suggests many people would be better off avoiding social media.
